# Model

## Role of the Model

In MVVM, the Model represents the applicationâ€™s data and business logic. It is completely independent of the UI and does not know anything about JavaFX or the View.

Key points:
- Encapsulates data structures, business rules, and persistence logic.
- Provides read/write access to data, often exposing observable data that can be consumed by the ViewModel.
- Should not handle UI logic (no TextField, Button, or Label references).

## JavaFX Model Components

The Model in JavaFX is just any generic class used to hold and manipulate data. It should be completly seperate form an UI ties.
